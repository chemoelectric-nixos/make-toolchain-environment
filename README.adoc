== NAME

make-toolchain-environment - manual page for make-toolchain-environment
2.0.0

== SYNOPSIS

*make-toolchain-environment* [_switches_] [_arguments_]

== DESCRIPTION

*-l*, *--libraries*::
  for shared libraries use linker scripts instead of symlinks

*-e*, *--regexp=*'PATTERN' same as *--libraries*, but using the given
regular expression

*-v*, *--verbose*::
  when something unusual happens, display a message
*-h*, *--help*::
  display this help, then exit
*--version*::
  output version information, then exit

You may use the short name "mte" instead of
"make-toolchain-environment".

The arguments are a list of directories, the last of which is where part
of an "environment" is to be constructed. All the other directories must
be absolute paths.

Patterns for the *--regexp* option must be in Unicode PCRE2 format. The
default pattern, used by the *--libraries* option, is

____
'^(/(?!plugins/)[^/]*)*/lib[^/]+\.so(\.[0-9]+)\{0,3}$'
____

ELF files whose paths satisfy the regular expression will be "copied" as
linker scripts instead of as symlinks.
